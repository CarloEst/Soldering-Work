      <p>
        This build tells a story of pushing through towards our goal even when things don't go as planned.
        When I started this scuplture, I wanted to build a well designed pyramid, but instead I ended with this non symmetrical
        sculpture that looks like one. Every imperfection in the sculpture, like the rounded corners, the uneven lengths are
        representations of roadblocks, but when we zoom out, we see a unique and pretty sculpture. I think it's a reminder that
        we shouldn't dwell over the little problems in the path towards our goals, and we should always look at the bigger picture,
        as these imperfections are what make our path unique.
