      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p class="muted">This is a PCB with a 555 Timer chip on a heart-shaped board.</p>
      <h2 style="margin-top:16px;">Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        As I started this project in February, I couldn't help but think of the highlight of this month: Valentine's Day. I decided that my PCB Timer board should be shaped as a heart. Not just to </br>
        commemorate the day of love, but because I believe that this build in all its imperfections, has the characteristics of what love entails. Love can be messy, hard, fueled with trial and error,</br>
        but at the same time, it's beautiful and unique, because despite everything, we find a way to make things work. When you look at this project, you see a mess. You see the traces of bad soldering,</br>
        traces of desoldering and the many scratches on the copper.</br>
        But we still end up with something beautiful, where all the imperfections came together to create this working masterpiece, similarly to how love has people come together despite their differences
        and hardships.</br>
